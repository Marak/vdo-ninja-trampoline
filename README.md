[OBS.Ninja Trampoline](https://rse.github.io/obs-ninja-trampoline/)
===================================================================

[OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja) is an awesome peer-to-peer (P2P),
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) and browser based solution for bringing
the video/audio streams of presenters into the live event production
software [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) with very low latency and
high quality. This form is just a URL simplification trampoline, i.e.,
it takes a few intuitive URL parameters and redirects to the underlying
complex technical URL of [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja). It allows you
to control [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja) parameters at a central place
while being able to use clean, intuitive and stable URLs for both the
presenters and [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com). The underlying
[OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja) parameter sets are rather opinionated
and hard-coded and are intended for meeting or broadcast sessions with
multiple presenters only. Broadcast sessions are like meetings, where
presenters can hear but not see each other, to reduce the network
bandwidth requirements of presenters.
