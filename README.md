===================================================================

About
-----

[OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja) is an awesome peer-to-peer (P2P),
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) and browser based solution for bringing
the video/audio streams of presenters into the live event production
software [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) with very low latency and
high quality.

This form is just a URL simplification trampoline, i.e., it takes a
few intuitive URL parameters and redirects to the underlying complex
technical URL of [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja). It allows you to
control [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja) parameters at a central place
while being able to use clean, intuitive and stable URLs for both the
presenters and [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com).

The underlying [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja) parameter sets are rather
opinionated and hard-coded and are intended for meeting or broadcast
sessions with multiple presenters only. Broadcast sessions are like
meetings, where presenters can hear but not see each other, to reduce
the network bandwidth requirements of presenters.

Installation
------------

There is no installation needed if you are using the Github URL
https://rse.github.io/obs-ninja-trampoline/. If you want to
use a different URL then copy the files [index.html](index.html)
and [jquery.js](jquery.js) to your own website.

Usage
-----

Go to [OBS.Ninja Trampoline](https://rse.github.io/obs-ninja-trampoline/)
(or your own website hosting OBS.Ninja Trampoline) and just use the form.
The form fields are:

- **Room Id**:

- **Room Password**:

- **Source URL**:
  This is your entry point.
  Copy this URL for accesssing OBS.Ninja through the clean, intuitive
  and stable parameters of OBS.Ninja Trampoline.

- **Target URL**:
  This is the redirection URL, based on the underlying complex parameters
  of OBS.Ninja. This is shown just for comprehension purposes.
